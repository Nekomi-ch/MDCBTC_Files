## Description

Nekomi become a rally driver after winning multiple sim-racing awards. 
However, he was recruited due to falling out with previous team for not obeying team orders.

Due to his unfortunate past involving [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], he lost most of his memory and may have occasional headaches while recollecting his past.
In addition with assesment from on-site psychologist, extra protocol and adjustments is needed to keep his mind in check.

Adjustments include
- Being heavily encouraged to write extra details about his mood and feelings in his diary during missions
- A therapist that specialised in ASD is needed in the main base in Switzerland which can be accessed through face time 24/7 (Due to affects of **Project 41**, **SC-041** Subie can be a good alternative)
- ~~Pain medication for his headaches~~ (Might not be needed due to affects of **SC-041**)
- Allowed to have Rubik's cubes for stimming during operations
- Allowed noise cancelling devices

Despite his shortcomings, he is able to demonstrate great abilities in controlling a car that is prone to oversteer.
He did this by using it to his advantage and having a drift driving style.
Not only that his boldness in his driving totally contridicts his personality. (Posibily inspired by Collin McRae)
From his words, he thinks that this is due to teachings of his master. ~~Which we hypothosise it is an alter-ego in his neurodivergent brain telling him what to do but some theorise that~~ said "master" ~~may~~ actually exsist. (See **Project 41**)
