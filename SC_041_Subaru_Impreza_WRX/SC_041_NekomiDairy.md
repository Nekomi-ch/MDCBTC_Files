Sigh... Honestly where should I even begin, a lot of things just happpened in front of my eyes for a split second, and now I lost all contact with my team, my phone is busted, and now I am in someone else's home.
Not only that her home is situated in the mountains with only access to car, that says a lot for a country with some of the best public transport system in the world.

Bad news is that the car is now busted, whole engine got fried. Hey at least its not really my fault tho, but I did pass out right after that, and of course I lost by default.
But I did remember one thing from that, for a moment I felt like I am being carried with both arms wrapping my back, but right after a moment I blacked out.
Not much I can say about that.

On the other hand that is the worst news I can really write in this notebook right now.
Can you believe I have to resort to the pacenotes book in my pocket right now?
Hope Mason won't mind.

Well the person that... or I should say... my master...
Yeah you heard me right, I am not crazy.
This is all real.

Her name is actually Subaru-chan from what I can tell, or I should say she reminded me.
But I also found out that I used to call her "Onee-san"?
Which from my bare-bones Japanese, this means older sister is what I can tell.
In all honetsly she did treat me quite well, so that sounds fitting.

Right before I got into her house, she brought me a place to look at the stars, I got to say it was beautiful, and when she revealed that I not only know her, she is the one that had taught me everything, she offered me a nice hug.
I was busy racing to not think of anything back then but if you think about the way we drive, it all makes sense.
I cried a river in her arms, its like I finally able to rest for so long of soul searching, just to find out that you're back home.

Currently, losing my phone might be a blessing in disguise. I got a lot of catching up and reconnect.
I honestly would prefer staying by her side for the time being instead of dealing with anything related with the organisation.
I have a lot to thank after all.
At most I will write this just to organise my mind after all of that has happened.

I am really happy that she is real, and in truth I am not insane.
That will keep my mind in a lot of ease.

Right now, she gave me a cup of milk then urges me to take a shower and go to sleep, after that we'll see what will be for me tomorrow.

Oh wow... How do I explain to myself what just happened to me last night. Quite frankly, I got introduced into a new world and it was fantastic.
I am not to sure but... did I just have segggs???????

And with my mas... AHHHHHHHHH >///<

She well... Right after I came out of the shower, she is right in front of the door, with bathrobe.
I didn't notice much as she wears the same robe that she gave me, just me borrowing her clothes while I stay at her place that's all. 
Also at the same time I heard calming saxophone music in the background, again, I thought it was music that she likes to hear really.

She hug my waist, pushed me against the wall. Held my hand.
Slowly her head approaches and whispers directly into my ear.
"Ara ara~ I really missed you you know. Wanna make up for it from all those years?"

I got very nervous but I do really feel the same to her.
I nodded.

"Well then, wanna make sure you won't forget about me this time?."

Then again I nodded out of nervousness with a hint of willingness.

"Good boy." She whispered and kissed at my ear.

She untied her robe. 
And the slip she revealed alrealy made my heart pound, somehow master have gotten a body that I really like I could barely hold it in but I am so embarassed at the same time.

She looked down on my body and notices a spot that I can't hold in. She then said "You are still really shy huh? But all those years, I know how bad of a liar you are. Just be honest and undress me alreadly darling."

I stopped covering my face with both my hands, used them to grab both ends of her robe and slowly open it.
Oh lord. Black lingeire with openings towards all three sentitive parts.
I can't resist.

Afterwards she picked me up, throwed me on the bed. And slowly undressed me whilst gently touching my upper body with her finger.

"Its your last chance to back out my darling. So anything to say?"

I simply gazed at her sultry body, touched her cheek and said, "I do really miss you nee-san."

"Hey come on! Don't beat around the bush, just tell me what you want."

I simply asked her to touch me and to be gentle. 
She went down on me touching every single inch of my body, of course I get to touch her's as well.
It was such a warm feeling as I lost control of my body and drowned in intimate pleasure.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I just.

Can't stop thinking about it.

Are you suppoed to be this close to your own master?

I do remember that Lancer warning me that I need to be careful of her cause she might do unspeakable things to me.
But man this was such a great mistake I have ever made.
