Sigh... Honestly where should I even begin, a lot of things just happpened in front of my eyes for a split second, and now I lost all contact with my team, my phone is busted, and now I am in someone else's home.
Not only that her home is situated in the mountains with only access to car, that says a lot for a country with some of the best public transport system in the world.

Bad news is that the car is now busted, whole engine got fried. Hey at least its not really my fault tho, but I did pass out right after that, and of course I lost by default.
But I did remember one thing from that, for a moment I felt like I am being carried with both arms wrapping my back, but right after a moment I blacked out.
Not much I can say about that.

On the other hand that is the worst news I can really write in this notebook right now.
Can you believe I have to resort to the pacenotes book in my pocket right now?
Hope Mason won't mind.

Well the person that... or I should say... my master...
Yeah you heard me right, I am not crazy.
This is all real.

Her name is actually Subaru-chan from what I can tell, or I should say she reminded me.
But I also found out that I used to call her "Onee-san"?
Which from my bare-bones Japanese, this means older sister is what I can tell.
In all honetsly she did treat me quite well, so that sounds fitting.

Right before I got into her house, she brought me a place to look at the stars, I got to say it was beautiful, and when she revealed that I not only know her, she is the one that had taught me everything, she offered me a nice hug.
I was busy racing to not think of anything back then but if you think about the way we drive, it all makes sense.
I cried a river in her arms, its like I finally able to rest for so long of soul searching, just to find out that you're back home.

Currently, losing my phone might be a blessing in disguise. I got a lot of catching up and reconnect.
I honestly would prefer staying by her side for the time being instead of dealing with anything related with the organisation.
I have a lot to thank after all.
At most I will write this just to organise my mind after all of that has happened.

I am really happy that she is real, and in truth I am not insane.
That will keep my mind in a lot of ease.

Right now, she gave me a cup of milk then urges me to take a shower and go to sleep, after that we'll see what will be for me tomorrow.

Oh wow... How do I explain to myself what just happened to me last night. Quite frankly, I got introduced into a new world and it was fantastic.
I am not to sure but... did I...

[MULTIPLE PARAGRAPHS HAS BEEN REDACTED]

Enough rambling for now, I woke up between my master's arms, thought I was paralysed for a while just to realise she had hold me tight during the whole sleep.
Yes she not only has a large body, she also has large strengh.
Hey at least she was gentle with me, and honestly, she had a massive glow-up if I can remember how she used to be like.

Honestly I still can't believe this is true that I can actually get to reunite with my master.
Even more so the fact that she is one of the car spirits, a hard one to find at that.
Given this circumstances, I feel like I should do some undercover investigation as I write this down to have better information.

If you think about it... I might be the first one who have had contact with one of those.

Anyways, when I try to wake up she said that she wanted to cuddle for a bit longer insead of getting off the bed.
To be fair her body feels very warm and soft at the moment, so I simply got myself back to sleep for a bit before us both wake up.

We then... well its more like she lifted me up, hugged me and walked me to her bathroom.
Taking a warm bubble bath together with a clear mountain view outisde the large window, is such a great experience.
As we continue off our fun from last night, we...

...felt gently violated but it felt so nice that I have to let her do her thing.
I believe Lancer has warned me her "tendences", but hey... why she even wanted to threaten me with a good time.
Not only that, I did place a bet of letting her do whatever she wanted to me right before the race, and my Skoda caught on fire so she won by default.
Also I need to pay her back from saving my life really...

Well after all that, we helped each other to wear our clothes, dried each other's hair, and I am as clean as I can.

`Note to self: She does have a nice smelling shampoo, might buy it if I can even find it.`
