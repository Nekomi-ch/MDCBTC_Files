# Nekomi's Diary

## March 28

Sigh... Honestly where should I even begin, a lot of things just happened in front of my eyes for a split second, and now I lost all contact with my team, my phone is busted, and now I am in someone else's home.
Not only that her home is situated in the mountains with only access to car, that says a lot for a country with some of the best public transport system in the world.

Bad news is that the car is now busted, whole engine got fried. Hey at least its not really my fault tho, but I did pass out right after that, and of course I lost by default.
But I did remember one thing from that, for a moment I felt like I am being carried with both arms wrapping my back, but right after a moment I blacked out.
Not much I can say about that.

On the other hand that is the worst news I can really write in this notebook right now.
Can you believe I have to resort to the pacenotes book in my pocket right now?
Hope Mason won't mind.

Well the person that... or I should say... my master...
Yeah you heard me right, I am not crazy.
This is all real.

Her name is actually Subaru-chan from what I can tell, or I should say she reminded me.
But I also found out that I used to call her "Onee-san"?
Which from my bare-bones Japanese, this means older sister is what I can tell.
In all honestly she did treat me quite well, so that sounds fitting.

Right before I got into her house, she brought me a place to look at the stars, I got to say it was beautiful, and when she revealed that I not only know her, she is the one that had taught me everything, she offered me a nice hug.
I was busy racing to not think of anything back then but if you think about the way we drive, it all makes sense.
I cried a river in her arms, its like I finally able to rest for so long of soul searching, just to find out that you're back home.

Currently, losing my phone might be a blessing in disguise. I got a lot of catching up and reconnect.
I honestly would prefer staying by her side for the time being instead of dealing with anything related with the organisation.
I have a lot to thank after all.
At most I will write this just to organise my mind after all of that has happened.

I am really happy that she is real, and in truth I am not insane.
That will keep my mind in a lot of ease.

Right now, she gave me a cup of milk then urges me to take a shower and go to sleep, after that we'll see what will be for me tomorrow.

## March 29

Oh wow... How do I explain to myself what just happened to me last night. Quite frankly, I got introduced into a new world and it was fantastic.
I am not to sure but... did I...

[MULTIPLE PARAGRAPHS HAS BEEN REDACTED]

Enough rambling for now, I woke up between my master's arms, thought I was paralysed for a while just to realise she had hold me tight during the whole sleep.
Yes she not only has a large body, she also has large strength.
Hey at least she was gentle with me, and honestly, she had a massive glow-up if I can remember how she used to be like.

Honestly I still can't believe this is true that I can actually get to reunite with my master.
Even more so the fact that she is one of the car spirits, a hard one to find at that.
Given this circumstances, I feel like I should do some undercover investigation as I write this down to have better information.

If you think about it... I might be the first one who have had contact with one of those.

Anyways, when I try to wake up she said that she wanted to cuddle for a bit longer instead of getting off the bed.
To be fair her body feels very warm and soft at the moment, so I simply got myself back to sleep for a bit before us both wake up.

We then... well its more like she lifted me up, hugged me and walked me to her bathroom.
Taking a warm bubble bath together with a clear mountain view outside the large window, is such a great experience.
As we continue off our fun from last night, we...

[MULTIPLE PARAGRAPHS HAS BEEN REDACTED]

...felt gently violated but it felt so nice that I have to let her do her thing.
I believe Lancer has warned me her "tendencies", but hey... why she even wanted to threaten me with a good time.
Not only that, I did place a bet of letting her do whatever she wanted to me right before the race, and my Skoda caught on fire so she won by default.
Also I need to pay her back from saving my life really...

Well after all that, we helped each other to wear our clothes, dried each other's hair, and I am as clean as I can.

`Note to self: She does have a nice smelling shampoo, might buy it if I can even find it.`

While I was making her breakfast, my signature scrambled eggs on toast of course.
I can't help myself but to wonder, why did she gave me my yellow hair bands in the first place.
So of course I had to ask her when I finished making it.

It turns out it belongs to the "Comet Squad", which are a group of people that have either contributed lots for the "Shogun" (Which is my "Onee-san" in my case), and also people that showed great potential and acts as a blessing.
In my missions with the Foundation, I have recieved different types of recognition and titles from powerful spirits, 
I even have one from the Lancia mafia family from that one time I have gone undercover, becoming one of their members apparently.

Yet this is the first time I have heard of this title, and I heard that it is revered among Japanese siprits.
Maybe this is why I got weird looks and suspicions given how clueless I am.
And maybe this is why the Fairlady has said that I was both cursed and blessed, saying that these bands gave me harsh times growing up,
but this would eventually repay you in the long run.
This might explain why it took me so many years just to see her again.
Not only that this is the first as well.

Right now my body is filled with bruises.
Not from the accident last night, but its Subaru-chan being... well Subaru-chan.
Giving me all those "love-marks" just so I don't forget about her this time.
Such a massive pervert... or I would like to say: Onee-san... ecchi...

## March 31

Alright, right now I have made a mental list of things that the foundation that definitely needs to know about.
Given the lack of information that we originally got, I will jot down things on this diary, so that things can be easier when I write this report.

Firstly, she loves anime. I mean not like people who just watches anime on occasion, or like me who draws every now and then.
She really, really loves anime, like...
She has a whole collect of manga, with some figures as well.
Not only that when I looked into some of them, there are a sizeable amount of BL.
Surpringly she somehow manages to still make all of that look tidy.

Secondly, I just really noticed just recently.
Every now and then she speaks or starts to say something.
Subaru-chan just says "Ara~ara"
I have no idea what that means but it does have a flirty tone to it I got to admit.

Thirdly, we know from Lancer-chan that she can get frisky sometimes.
As a whole team, we certanly have encounted spirits with wildly different personalities.
Some can be timid and pure while some can get flirty, and its our job to cater to their needs.

However this... 
I swear, it feels like she is like three standard deviations away from the norm.
A total nymphomaniac.
I can barely keep up with all those "Night lessons" she is giving me.
And when my skin started to heal, she is going to make some more.
But hey, she does have a nice body so I ain't complaining.
Besides, I do feel like I always wanted to get closer to her throughout this journey.
Not only that, I have been kiss-less, hug-less, touch-less for most of my life,
so everynight when we sleep together, I do feel like someone is willing to stay close to me.

Right now... I haven't told her this yet but tommorow is actually my birthday.
Just as a test of the extent of how much she do remember about me I am not going to say a thing and see how things goes.
Oh well, hope its going to be good tommorow.


## April 1 (Birthday)

At first I woke up as usual, in her bed, cuddled together, but a bit leter than usual.
(Yes we are both naked as well)
Not gonna lie I think I started to like her more these days.
Before I can even prepare myself to make brunch(Its like 1100 at this point), she hold me back and said,
"We got something to do today, let me bring you somewhere."
As she used me to get ready, she also told me that I would be driving this time.

Wait didn't my car got destoryed a couple of days ago.

It seems that she wasn't joking, she is making me to drive her (car).

Again through this mission I have experienced many kinds of cars,
but this is different.
This time I tried approaching it I somehow feel surreal in some way.
I feel easier while dealing the murderous Delta S4 than this 22B
Usually everytime I can experience a new car I just get excited and just hop straight in.
Now I seem froze right before touching the handle.

Maybe its just so happen to be the one my once mysterious master drive.
Or maybe this is also the car that left me behind years ago, and I was scared.

"Ara-ara don't be shy, I think it's time to show me what you got." I remember her saying
I did get myself to open the car door and get a look inside,
just to see the same old interior that I think I sat in.
If I wasn't mistaken, she was cuter back then, but less sexy I suppose, and I was just a little guy barely know how to drive.
But this time, I was going to sit on the same seat that she normally sits on.

When I get to sit in it, it seems like I am very used to it.
Arguably it feels as comfotable as my previous car.
Yet, I feel like this is a completely new thing for me.

Then I slowly start the car,
hit the clutch, rev it a bit,
put it in gear and let it flow.
This time unlike every car I tried, it seems perfectly suits me.
It just flows, I don't have other thing to say other than it just suits me from the start.

She of course showed me the directions for the place and we ended up in a sushi restaurant.
There is a lot of good Japanese food but this is definitely my favourite.
She let me order what I want and the chef makes the tasty pieces of fish on rice infront of me.
Tried sushi many times and yet this still manages to amaze me.

"Are you supposed to day something darling" she said.
I really, really wanted to say to her the fact that it is my birthday, but I wanna keep it a surprise.
I just replied that the food is great.
Because even though she might not know, and I am away from my friends and family in the middle of a foreign nation.
This is alreadly a great day to go for my birthday.

"Alright then, lets talk somewhere else."
After I just finished my meal, she paid for it and picked me up to her car.
She is the one driving by the way.

We then got near a river with a lot of cherry blossom trees on both sides.
Somehow despite this view, I am surpiried that she managed to find a place where not many people are viewing at the same time.
From what I heard they tend to get very crowded.

I was at awe to see how nice this view can really be.
Then she told me, that the STI badge used to be pink, and its based on those flowers.
She also said that this always about how life is short, but it will always be new or something of that sort.
But in the middle of those facts, she then said.
"I always wanted to see that time you finally bloom, I belive I came just on time."

"Tanjoubi Omedetou Nekomi-kun, Happy birthday Nekomi!"
"Or maybe even 'Sang Yat Fai Lok'?"

As I looked into the endless sea of flowers while she hugged me from the back.
Getting all teary eyed.
Knowing this could dissapear at any time, I wanted her to stay with me as long as god allows.
Not a birthday I expected but one that will remember.

For reminding me how I came to be:
"Arigato nee-san."

``PS She then revealed that she had a slight recollection of when's my birthday but she wasn't sure, 
but all she knows is that I left the calander of my diary open on the table with BIG LETTERS on today.
GOD I AM AWFUL AT KEEPING SECRETS.``
