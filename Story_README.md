# Introduction

Since the founding of the Sentient motors foundation, we have to make a lot of files to keep up with all the cases of so called "Car Spirits". Hence we made this system shortly after the first few spirits that we found to document every incident that we had experienced and recorded.

I have instructed our drivers staff members to keep a good track of things to maintain the integrity of the system and to make sure this whole process can be run smoothly. In addition we have made standards that make sure we have a unified format for the whole system for easier organization.

So please treat this whole thing with care and respect, and it shall reward you with a smooth work flow.

Sincerely,
M.
