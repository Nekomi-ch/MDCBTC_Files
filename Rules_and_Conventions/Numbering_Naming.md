# Numbering and Naming

This underlines the general rules for numbering and naming things.

- All numbering should be preceded by the letters "SC-" for Spirits and "D-" for drivers
- Number 001 is skipped due to racing tradition of No.1 for the reigning champion, hence things start with 002
- Numbers involving current driver numbers would be skipped, but each drivers could appoint one "Spirit" with their own number
- Numbers of "DriverNumber + 1" should also be skipped for co-drivers to choose their "Spirit" of their own
- Number 42 and 43 shall be skipped in honour of our fallen colleagues
- > Extra Note: Due to Nekomi's number being `D-41`, his co-driver Mason's number shall be `D-44`

Taking our first find the Ford Escort Cosworth RS as an example with designated number of: `SC-002`
